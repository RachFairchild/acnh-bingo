## FAQ

#### Why "Bingo Hopper"?

We've all been there: with only 10 spots on your island and 419 possible villagers, it's no surprise that the decisions we make in occupying our *Animal Crossing: New Horizons* islands can become a hotly debated topic. But choosing villagers isn't as simple as a point and click.

"Island hopping" is a term borne of the unending quest for the perfect set of neighbors. In order to find your favorite "dreamy," users will often fly from island to island in order to find that 1 of 419. Island hopping is not for the faint of heart, and can take [hours or days](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA-ueFYqWjU). In order to make things a little more interesting, users often create their own bingo cards and check off the villagers they have found while searching for their ultimate dreamy.

Bingo Hopper allows users to immediately begin generating and using *Animal Crossing*-themed bingo boards. This app is a niche and lightweight solution for professional streamers and casual gamers alike. Use Bingo Hopper on your own or share with your followers for your next island hopping stream.

#### Can I save my board?

Boards are automatically saved using a local storage solution, enabling users to refresh, close their tab, and visit the site at a later date. Your board will remain the same as long as the user's cache is not cleared.

#### Can I choose what villagers are on my board?

At the moment this is a planned optimization. In the future, users will be able customize their boards in the following ways:
 - Specify the exact villagers on their boards
 - Access additional sizing options (in addition to the standard 5x5)
 - Create randomization parameters (i.e., make a board of exclusively frog villagers)
